<h1 align="center">Connect Four</h1>

This project was given as a final exam project for "Principles of Computer Programming" at Singidunum University. The goal of this course was to teach students about programming fundamentals, memory management and I/O operations. To combine all the knowledge we learned, we were tasked to make a game of [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).

The game had to be fully playable between two players where each player takes a turn to place a checker on the board. Once either player connect four checkers in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) or the board fills up, the game ends and displays the winner. Once the game is over, the players can choose to start over or exit to the main menu. During gameplay, at any point the players can choose to save the game and finish it at a later time.
